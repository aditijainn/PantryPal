Omelette - X (or whichever ingredients you have!), eggs, milk, butter - Heat butter in a pan over medium heat. Beat eggs in a bowl with milk and season with salt and pepper. Pour egg mixture into hot pan. Once the bottom of the omelette is light golden brown, gently fold in half and slide onto a plate. Enjoy!
